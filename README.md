IPL is one of the most popular cricket leagues in the world. In this project, I have developed and deployed a Machine Learning model for predicting the powerplay scores of a particular innings of a particular match, using past history of ipl matches. Given some information about the match (like venue, batting and bowling teams, no. of players who batted in powerplay, no. of players who bowled in powerplay,etc) , the model can predict the number of runs scored by the batting team during the powerplay.

   The dataset available contains ball-by-ball information, hence I have performed the required preprocessing to extract the exact variables that can be used by our model. I have tried different ML algorithms from linear regression to xgboost in this project.
